# Drips JavaScript SDK

The JavaScript SDK for 💦 [drips.network](https://drips.network/).

Drips is an 💎 Ethereum protocol for creating continuous funding streams (Drips) and splitting funding streams among multiple recipients. With Drips, no 💸 commissions, predatory 👔 middle-men, or 🏦 banks are involved.

Drips is a part of the [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) ecosystem of projects. See the [docs](https://v2.docs.drips.network/docs/whats-a-drip.html) for more details about the Drips protocol and and its use.

## API Documentation

You can find the API documentation [here](https://melodious-bombolone-ca37e0.netlify.app/).

You can also browse the docs locally:

- Clone the project.
- Run `npm install`.

## Running the Examples Apps

The repository contains two example apps (built with `SvelteKit`) demonstrating how you can start building on Drips with the SDK.
They also serve as "interactive" documentation, covering the major client's operations.
These examples are not production-ready applications and do not demonstrate software engineering best practices in building Svelte apps.

To run the `NFTDriverClient` examples app locally:

- From the project's root dir run `cd nft-driver-examples/`
- Run `npm run dev -- --open`

You can find a hosted version of the `NFTDriverClient` examples app [here](https://drips-js-sdk.vercel.app/).

To run the `AddressDriverClient` examples app locally:

- From the project's root dir run `cd address-driver-examples/`
- Run `npm run dev -- --open`

You can find a hosted version of the `AddressDriverClient` examples app [here](https://lovely-froyo-8d2419.netlify.app/).
