# ðŸ’§ Drips SDK

The **Drips SDK** is a TypeScript library for building applications that interact with the [Drips protocol](https://github.com/drips-network/contracts). It wraps much of the [Drips App](https://www.drips.network)'s functionality to make common operations re-usable.

The Drips SDK exposes a type-safe API for:
- Drip Lists creation and management
- One-time and continuous donations
- Fund collection
- Utility functions
