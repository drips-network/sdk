# Drips JS SDK
A Javascript SDK for 💦 [drips.network](https://drips.network/). 

Drips is an 💎 Ethereum protocol for creating continuous funding streams (Drips) and also for splitting funding streams among multiple recipients. With Drips there are no 💸 commissions, predatory 👔 middle-men, or 🏦 banks involved. 

Drips is also a part of the [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) ecosystem of projects. See the [Drips docs](https://docs.drips.network/) for more details about the Drips protocol and how to use it.

### How To Use This SDK

The Drips SDK is intended to be used by developers primarily as a Javascript package installed into their projects. We plan to add the project to npm soon, but for now, users can include it into their project's package.json as a dependency by using this command:

`npm i https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-js-sdk#v0.1.1`

### Getting Started With Examples

The [Drips SDK Examples](https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-sdk-examples) repository is a separate repo containing example code that shows how the Drips SDK can be integrated into different types of Javascript projects. It's a great place to get started for users interested in exploring the SDK and learning how it works.
